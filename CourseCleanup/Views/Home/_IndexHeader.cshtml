    CourseCleanup is a HangFire web app that will allow an admin to run a query to list all course shells for a given term range.  A course shell is a course that has no content or activity.  
    Once the report is generated, the user will receive an email notifying them that their report is ready.  The user will be able to click a link to view the generated table of course shells.

    The user will have the ability to:
    - Select course shells for deletion
    - Delete all course shells

    The CourseCleanup app will also have a report showing all courses that were deleted using this tool.
